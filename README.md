# Sup!

is a revolutionary iOS application created using the new Swift programming language by Apple Inc. and data is stored in a Postgresql database managed by our Ruby on Rails REST JSON API. The app allows you to send a message to anyone, anywhere, at anytime. It is one of the most iconic applications to date. And it is social, mobile, and local. Otherwise known as SoMoLo or is it MoSoLo? Or MoLoSo? Well whatever it is, it's going to make the world a better place through Sup!'s REST API platform for programmatically sending and receiving simple scalable messages with our Ruby on Rails application for managing the Postgresql back end database to save lives and make cancer smaller. And AIDS. And Ebola. And Herpes. Simply type your friend's username into the bar and tap to send him/her a Sup! (not a rip off of Yo! or Bro! or anything else. It is a completely original idea that everyone else stole from us).

Type to find. Tap to Sup!.

is this project scrapped?
